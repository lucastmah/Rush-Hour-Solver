# Rush Hour Solver w/ Danh Vo
This is a solver for the game Rush Hour, where you must shuffle cars around to create a path for the red car to get to the right side. This algorithm takes a text file with a 6x6 board representation where "." represents blank spaces, "X" represents the red car, and all same letters represent 1 car. This follows a Breadth First Search algorithm, resulting in shorter solution paths.
